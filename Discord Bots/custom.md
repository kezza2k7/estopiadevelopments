## Introduction

A custom Discord bot is a powerful tool that can greatly enhance the functionality and interactivity of your Discord server. These bots are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from moderating chat, scheduling events, playing music, to even integrating with other services and platforms.

Custom Discord bots are tailored to your specific needs and requirements. They can be programmed to respond to specific commands, automate tasks, and provide a unique experience for your server members. Whether you run a gaming group, a music fan club, a business community, or any other type of server, a custom Discord bot can provide features that are specifically designed for your community.

With our service, you have the opportunity to bring your ideas to life. We work closely with you to understand your needs and create a bot that fits perfectly with your server's culture and rules. Plus, with our ongoing support, you can ensure that your bot continues to serve your community effectively as it grows and evolves.

## FAQ

### Do you give the Source Code

This is decided in the Plan made when ordering.

### What language is it made in?

It will be made in Javascript using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

### 3rd Party APIs

I will use third party APIs for Discord Bots, even tho they can be very glitchy and unstable, but I still do them for use of Sonoran CAD, meme commands and other fun commands like them.
