This is decided in the Plan made when ordering.

It will be made in Javascript using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

I will use third party APIs for Discord Bots, even tho they can be very glitchy and unstable, but I still do them for use of Sonoran CAD, meme commands and other fun commands like them.
